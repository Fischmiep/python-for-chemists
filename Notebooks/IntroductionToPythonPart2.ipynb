    "Functions are the simplest way to maximize code reuse, minimize redundancy, and to decompose your script/program into pieces with well defined roles. When you want to write a function you write the `def` keyword. This declares that what follows will have a certain pattern.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def name_of_function(param1, param2, param3, ..., paramN):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return ...\n",
    "```\n",
    " - `def` starts the function declaration\n",
    " - `name_of_function` tells Python under which name to store the function object\n",
    " - `param1, param2,...` are the parameters that you have to provide the function with when you call it\n",
    " - `...` is the function body. Here goes anything you wish, as long as its valid Python code\n",
    " - `return` this is what leaves the function\n",
    " \n",
    "A function can be thought of like a manufacture. Some well defined product arrives at the door of the manufacture. It is brought into the manufacture. Maybe it is reboxed to better fit the needs of the process within the manufacture. Something is done to the product. It's boxed again and leaves the manufacture in a different state than it arrived."
